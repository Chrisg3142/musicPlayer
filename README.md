<h2>This project uses express for the back end, JavaScript for frontend such as button function, html, css.</h2>



Express was used to handle the url inputs from the user and process it into a command line promt to 
first check if there is a duplicate file with the same name in the system. The command extracts the audio only from the 
video url the user entered and adds it to a queue to be played.
