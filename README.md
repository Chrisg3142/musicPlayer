This project uses express for the back end, JavaScript for frontend such as button function, html, css.

Express was used to handle the url inputs from the user and process it into a command line promt to 
first check if there is a duplicate file with the same name in the system. The command extracts the audio only from the 
video url the user entered and adds it to a queue to be played.
