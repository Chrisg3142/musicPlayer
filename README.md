# Music Player Project

## Requirements for project to run properly

- This project will run normally with the songs already provided in the folders.
- If you want to add your own songs to the queue using a YouTube link, you **must have `yt-dlp` installed**.
- The easiest way to install `yt-dlp` on macOS is via **Homebrew**.
